<H1>Bug List - Wish List</H1>The following are noted problems
with the <A
NAME="0" HREF="../WorldWideWeb.html">WWW app on the NeXT</A> . See
also the list of <A
NAME="1" HREF="Features.html">bug fixes and features</A>
added, and JFG's notes towards his<A
NAME="3" HREF="Upgrade.html">
upgrade proposal</A> .  These are the
serious bugs first:
<UL>
<LI>No Alert Panel when Cmd/O with bad
access code.
<LI>Inserting at beginning of paragraph
get style of previous paragraph!
<LI>Saving a reference to a news article
in an html file screws up the address
(adds a directory to it!)
<LI>Highlighting  is not implemented.
Any character highlighting is removed
from a file when it is saved (except
that of the paragraph styles).
<LI>Quit doesn't check for unsaved files!
</UL>
<H2>Here are the less serious ones:</H2>
<UL>
<LI>When you do a CMD-O [or Cmd/F] it
probably should position the text
cursor in the field where you type
the reference (Ira H. Fuchs )
<LI>Supress anchors in printed document
using stylesheet
<LI>The password given for anonymous
FTP should have the actual user name,
not "user".
<LI>If (save) fails, then try (save as)
to get, amongst other things, path
creation for the profile files.
<LI>Style editor does not  allow styles
to be modified properly. 
<LI>Cutting and pasting anchors leaves
them grey but strips them of their
anchor status. (This is because the
"info" inormation is not copied in
to rtf. Can we extend rtf?).
<LI>You can't put anchors into plain
text files or plain text sections.
<LI>HyperText is not automatically resized
when one resizes the window with
the mouse. 
</UL>
<H2>News:</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Reply 430 "article not available(?)"
converted to "cannot contact server".
Must be more intelligent about different
replies.  
<LI>Should try loading saved file instead
of unavailable article.
</UL>
<H2>Improvements desirable:</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Dispense with the  SGML tag in stylesheets,
or make stylesheet completely SGML-oriented.
 -done  but style sheet not user
editable yet.
<LI>Neat idea:   Allow the user to create
a "Services" menu item to search
any WWW database for a string (phone
book etc). Lots of attachments under
3.0.
<LI>Allow .uri files just have meta info.
 Great for mailing to people.
<LI>URI pastborad type
<LI>HTML pasteboard  type
<LI>rtf or SGML for style sheet format.
 Or use interpreteed language.
<LI>Remote files should be copied locally,
especially if they require opening
in the workspace.  (Ira H. Fuchs
)  Done.
<LI>File access: open directories as
README plus file list - or open them
in the workspace?
<LI>Perhaps have selection of various
blanks which one could use, for annotations,
text sections, footnotes, etc.
<LI>A style menu with each style as an
item -done
<LI>Automatically insert paragraph prefix
when RETURN pushed in list, delete
when paragraph deleted.
</UL>
<H2>Not included yet but won't be missed
yet:</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Link Typing. 
<LI>"Seen flag" -  hash table of all
seen nodes. Link with .newsrc? Server-specific?
 Mosaic compatible?
<LI>Annotate: Make unique message-id
for file name, save locally if poss
else in user area. Use different
template (note.html)
<LI>Format negotiation.  -- done
<LI>Concept of a 32-bit pointer to a
name in a hash table for such things
as style names, Format names, etc.
Associated with a list of things
with that name. Is this a NXAtom?
 Done: HTAtom.
<LI>Create the $(HOME)/WWW subdirectory
if necessary.
<LI>Default styles held in program in
case system styles don't exist. 
Done! stylesheet not really used
much. Style sheet needs sorting out.</BODY>
