<TITLE>Hypertext HTML formatting example</TITLE>
<h1>Test Dataset</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This file contains a test set of HTML mark-up, as a test of hypertext browsers and
an example of the syntax of the tags. See also:
<ol>
<li><a href=news:1990Oct17.231522.17662@midway.uchicago.edu>An arbitrary news
article</a>
<li><a href=news:alt.hypertext>The newsgroup on hypertext</a>
<li><a href=file:/tbl/hypertext/TheProject.html>More details about the WWW project.</a>
</ol>
<h2>Some anchors</h2>
<h3>Leading to whole nodes</h3>
Here is an anchor which leads to <a Href=http://crnvmc/FIND/PUB.P.HELPCMS.FIND(X,G)>the VM <hp2>FIND</hp2> command.</a> Note the nested highlighting (hp2) within the
anchor.
If you want to click on <a href=file:/usr/local/lib/WWW/default.html>this,</a>
you will go to the system default page.
<h3>Leading to anchors within nodes</h3>
Now <a href=#2>THIS</a> leads to anchor #2 in this file,
and if you want to click on <a href=file:/usr/local/lib/WWW/default.html#2>THIS,</a>
you should go to the system default page with anchor #2 selected.
Now the word <a name=dest1>"destination"</a> is a named destination anchor,
connected to the word <a href=#dest1>"source"</a>. Clicking on the destination
shouldn't do anything. Selecting the source should lead to the destination.

Now let's go through the limited set of markup tags which we accept.
The title, "Hypertext HTML formatting example" was between TITLE tags.
"Test Dataset" at the top of this page was a Level One Heading (H1).
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. In Hertford, Hereford and hampshire, hurricanes hardly happen.
<h2>Level two heading</h2>
Here is some text which follows the heading. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. In Hertford, Hereford and hampshire, hurricanes hardly happen.
<h3>Level 3 heading</h3>
Here is some text which follows the heading. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. In Hertford, Hereford and hampshire, hurricanes hardly happen.
<P>
This is a test paragraph. It is separated from the previous one by a P paragraph mark.

This new paragraph was separated from the previous one by a blank line, a horrible
leftover from SCRIPT, which violates the free format of the text.

This was delimited in the same way in the source. The blank line should have the
same effect as a paragraph mark.
We have included in HTML <hp2>some</hp2> tags from the SGML tagset used at and once supported at CERN by
<a href=http://crnvmc/FIND?sgml>
quite a lot of documentation and SGML examples.</a>
The HTML parser will ignore tags which it does not understand, and will ignore
attributes which it does not understand of CERN-SGML tags.
Of course, the HTML parser will not accept any commands in the
<a href=http://crnvmc/FIND/pub.p.helpcms.xscript>SCRIPT</a> language.
<p>Now for an example section, in monospaced font:
<xmp>
         _-_
        [o,o]
         \-/

   This text is laid out using fixed-width characters
                               -----------
   It uses the <XMP> tag, and can contain embedded < and > signs. It has
   tabs every eight columns like good old simple systems we know and love.

!	!	!	!	!	!	!	!	!	!	
Column:	First	Second	Third	Fourth	Fifth	Sixth	Seventh	Eighth	Ninth
Index:	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9
Junk:	The	Quick	brown	fox	jumps	over	the	lazy	dog.
</xmp>
After the example text, we revert to the default again.
<h3>Glossary</h3>
Now lets us try out a glossary.
<dl>
<dt>Glossary<dd>A list of definitions of terms. Each term is given in a left-hand column, with a longer textual definition being given in a right-hand column.
<dt>Term<dd>A word or phrase being defined.
<dt>Definition<dd>A sentences or sentences which define the term. the definition can wrap around in the second column, but the term can't wrap around in the second column.
</dl>
And after that dazzling display of formatting, how about an ordered list:
(We support it as an unordered list)
<ol>
<li>This is the first element of an ordered list
<li>This is the 2nd element of an ordered list. This element contains more text than one would normally expect to fit onto a line.
It should wrap around onto the next line(s) with the left margin still indented.
<li>This is the 3rd element of an ordered list
<li>This is the 4th element of an ordered list
</ul>
And now, how about an unordered list:
<ul>
<li>This is the first element of an unordered list
<li>This is the 2nd element of an unordered list
<li>This is the 3rd element of an unordered list
<li>This is the 4th element of an unordered list
</ul>
Now let's try a "LISTING" section.
<LISTING>
123456781234567812345678123456781234567812345678123456781234567812345678123456781234567
!	!	!	!	!	!	!	!	!	!	!
Column:	First	Second	Third	Fourth	Fifth	Sixth	Seventh	Eighth	Ninth	Tenth
Index:	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10
Junk:	The	Quick	borwn	fox	jumps	over	the	lazy	dog	again!
</LISTING>
This is the end of the test file.
