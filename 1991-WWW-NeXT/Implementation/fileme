The very first RARE WG-ISUS Newsletter (4+5/92)


Ok, I am sorry, You have been waiting too long and I ought to fell
ashamed and all that, but here I am again after Innsbruck and every-
thing. Those not present in Innsbruck might wonder about the header,
but that is what we are today, RARE Working Group Information Services
and User Support. Jill is chairing, and Erik(which by the way is Erik:-))
is "godfathering" from the RTC. He better behave, otherwise we will shoot
his cloud down :-). The last day of the conference it was decided that
we should merge with the EARN-info group, which we did, and we hope
that only good things will come out of that. It was also discussed
in the RIPE community to merge in the RIPE-info group, but I do not
think that anything was decided. I guess Jill will follow with a lot
more detail, as she usually does.

The RTR 1 showed up in the participant bags (a nice one), as well as
a document called "The state of the Union". The latter can be seen on the
sunic gopher divided into countries, and will soon be followed by RTR 1
divided in the same way, and of course any other information about your
network that you are willing to provide me with.

ARCHIE

There is an article in the March edition of NSF Network News about archie
, giving some new contact addresses to the McGill Archie Group:

		Comments, bugreports etc -> archie-l@cs.mcgill.ca

		Additions and corrections-> archie-admin@cs.mcgill.ca

HYPER-G

Florian Schnabel from Austria demonstrated their new information
server in Innsbruck, a very potent thing really, could talk to
almost everything, gopher and WWW, could show used links, could
show commands in different laguages, could take uploads from
personal computers and convert file formats. Florian, I just
can not wait until you put that up for ftp ! And I hope that
you notify this list when you do !

That`s all I have this time, Below follows some history about NORDUnet,
and a nice diagram showing the Iceland link upgrade :-).
Some of the links (including that to London) are operational when this
is written.

Bye for now, and see you in Berlin (or Pisa or whatever !)

Planned and ordered upgrades during 1992

                Current         Upgrade         Delivery
--------------------------------------------------------
Amsterdam       256K            512K            920617
Poland          9.6K             64K            9204 done
Estonia          -               64K            9204 done
London           -              256K            9205
--------------------------------------------------------

Links to Poland and Estonia are now established but do not currently
carry production traffic. The major problem with Estonia is that the
top level domain for EE has not yet been registered by the NIC and thus
names and numbers cannot be mapped in a proper way. The new link to
Poland will be spilt into a dedicated 9.6 X.25 circuit, a dedicated
9.6k BSC/EARN circuit until something like VMNET could be use, and the
rest for pure IP.
The Ebone link to London will hopefully be in production during next week.


History of significant events 9204
==================================

920403  Ebone/Stockholm starts to be implemented. EBS1 and EBS4(scan-gw)
        up and running.
920409  The new 768K US link up and running stable.
920410  First conntact established via the 64K satelite link between
        Stockholm and Tallinn (Estonia).
920428  EBS3 for the Nordic carriers connection to Ebone up and running.


One of the more desperatly needed upgrades done was the upgrade from
9.6Kbps to 56Kbps of the link to Iceland. 64K is currently not available
on this satellite link to Iceland.
